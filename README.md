# Mike M

Hi, I'm Mike.
* I'm a Sysadmin.
* I'm tring to learn to code.
* I've worked in various areas of IT, but primarily as a Sysadmin, since 2008.
* I have a homelab where I self-host a lot of services.
* As a SysAdmin I've done a lot of scripting and actual programming seems like the next logical step.
